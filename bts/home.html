        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
            BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a seven-member South Korean
            boy
            band that was formed in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment. The septet—composed of Jin,
            Suga,
            J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces much of their own output. Originally a hip hop
            group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres.
        </p>


        <h3>
            Formation and early years
        </h3>
        <p>
            BTS began its formation in 2010 after Big Hit Entertainment CEO Bang Si-hyuk met with group leader RM and
            was
            impressed with his rapping. The lineup was finalized with Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook in
            2012
            when Jin, the oldest member of the group, was twenty-years-old. Six months prior to their debut, they began
            to
            gain attention for their presence on various social media websites, as well as song covers on YouTube and
            SoundCloud.
        </p>


        <h3>
            Mainstream and international breakthrough
        </h3>
        <p>
            In November 2017, BTS became the first K-pop group to perform at the American Music Awards, raising their
            profile internationally. That same month, Guinness World Records revealed that BTS had earned a spot in
            their
            2018 edition for "having the world's most Twitter engagements for a music group". In December, they also
            became
            the first K-pop group to perform on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve to welcome the new year and made
            their
            Japanese TV music show debut on TV Asahi's Japan Music Station Super Live.
        </p>


        <h3>
            Cultural Impact
        </h3>
        <p>
            Billboard's Senior Vice President Silvio Pietroluongo said that BTS are comparable to and as influential as
            the
            Beatles and the Monkees. Nielsen Music Vice President Helena Kosinski said that "although BTS weren't the
            first
            to open the doors to K-Pop worldwide, they were the first to become mainstream. They don't just appeal to
            young
            people but also to the 50s and 60s age demographic." As the first non-English speaking artist to make the
            Global
            Artist Chart in 2018, BTS had the second and third best-selling albums worldwide and were the second
            best-selling artists worldwide in terms of physical, digital, and streaming platforms, coming second only to
            Drake.
